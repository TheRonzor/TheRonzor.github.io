            <p class = "p-left-indent"> (Throughout grad school): Undergraduate mentoring in computational genomics and bioinformatics. Taught biology undergradutes involved in research projects how to use 
                various bioinformatics programs, scripting in Python, MATLAB, R, and Bash.  Students: Madison Folmer, Hunter Call, Maliha Ahmed, and Scott Teresi (below).
            </p>
            <p class = "p-left-indent"> Spring 2018: Mentored undergradute Scott Teresi (Biology, William &amp Mary) on a genomics project, investigating the "Origin and evolution of the octoploid strawberry genome".  The resulting paper was recently (end of 2018) accepted for publication in Nature Genetics, currently pending some minor formatting changes.</p>
            <p class = "p-left-indent"> Fall 2017: Spring 2018: Mentored high school senior Jakob Weiss (Governor's School for Science and Technology, Hampton, VA) on "Developing a population genetics model for transposable elements". The research involved (genomics) data analysis, mathematical modeling of recombination and introductory population genetics.  Jakob recieved a perfect score on his final presentation and was accepted into the Physics program at Boston College with full tuition support.</p>
            <p class = "p-left-indent"> 2015 - 2017: (every other semester): Teaching assistant for Cellular Biophysics and Modeling at William &amp Mary. Held regular review sessions (2-3 hrs/wk) and assisted with grading.</p>
            <p class = "p-left-indent"> Spring 2014: Calculus tutor at SUNY Old Westbury (Old Westbury, NY). Worked for a professor who was a colleague of my undergraduate advisor. Attended class, assisted with instruction and met with students after hours. Delivered one full period lecture on intro to exponential and logarithmic functions and their derivatives.</p>
            <p class = "p-left-indent"> Spring 2008: Physics tutor at Farmingdale State College (Farmingdale, NY). Hired by the physics chair (as a college employee) after taking Physics I with him.</p>
            <p class = "p-left-indent"> 2008-2014: Trainer / "Consultant", Henry Schein, Inc. (Melville, NY) Acted as department trainer on our software systems, some of which I developed.  
                Also worked with various departments as an internal consultant, helping to design solutions (generally software), beginnning with problem conception and ending with deployment and training others how to use the new system(s).</p>
